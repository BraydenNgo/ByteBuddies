Students get internships all the over the world. This requires them to find housing in a new place and in this economy rent is propabaly too high. Therefore they need to get roomates to split the cost of rent. But most of the time this usually happens in small discussion boards like discords or facebook. Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to see other people who also got that internship or someone who also moving to that new city so you guys can become roommates. 


### Challenege: It was diffcult to create a database so the information input to place into an algorithm so the most compatiatble roommate could be found.
